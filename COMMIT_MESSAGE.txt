fix(build): Ensure JSON schemas regenerate when proto files change

This fixes a critical bug where JSON schemas weren't being regenerated when 
proto files were modified. This caused validation failures when proto field 
names or types were changed but the JSON schemas weren't updated.

The fix explicitly includes proto source files as inputs to the build action,
ensuring that any change to proto files will trigger schema regeneration.

Also improved:
- Added error handling in schema generation shell command
- Added debugging output showing which proto is being processed
- Fixed indentation issues in the build rule
- Added documentation explaining the issue and fix

To fully apply this fix:
1. Replace proto_json_schema.bzl with proto_json_schema.bzl.fixed
2. Run 'bazel clean' to clean any stale artifacts
3. Rebuild your project

IMPORTANT: When making changes to proto files that affect JSON schemas,
you should run 'bazel clean' to ensure all generated artifacts are rebuilt.
